# Alcohol Consumption by Diagnosis Bar Charts

I used a dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository called Fertility and converted the numerical values to their corresponding names. Then, I made a bar chart that shows the Alcohol Consumption by Diagnosis, which has 5 different categories for how often the men who were tested consumed alcohol.
